# About

This is a customized [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) build for SARS-CoV-2.
It is based on publicly-available builds, visible at [nextstrain.org/ncov](https://nextstrain.org/ncov).

Visit [the workflow documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/ncov) for tutorials and reference material.

## Bioinformatics notes

Site numbering and genome structure uses [Wuhan-Hu-1/2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) as reference. The phylogeny is rooted relative to early samples from Wuhan. Temporal resolution assumes a nucleotide substitution rate of [8 &times; 10^-4 subs per site per year](http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-176-genomes-6-mar-2020/356). There were SNPs present in the nCoV samples in the first and last few bases of the alignment that were masked as likely sequencing artifacts.
