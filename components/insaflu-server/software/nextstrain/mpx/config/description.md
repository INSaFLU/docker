Monkeypox outbreak genomes come from the following sources:

- Monkeypox/PT0001/2022: [Isidro et al. First draft genome sequence of Monkeypox virus associated with the suspected multi-country outbreak, May 2022](https://virological.org/t/first-draft-genome-sequence-of-monkeypox-virus-associated-with-the-suspected-multi-country-outbreak-may-2022-confirmed-case-in-portugal/799). 9 additional sequences where shared by these authors in an additional post [Multi-country outbreak of Monkeypox virus: genetic divergence and first signs of microevolution](https://virological.org/t/multi-country-outbreak-of-monkeypox-virus-genetic-divergence-and-first-signs-of-microevolution/806).
- MPXV_USA_2022_MA001: [Gigante, et al. Draft monkeypox virus genome from confirmed monkeypox case in Massachusetts, United States, May 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ON563414)
- MPXV-BY-IMB25241: [Antwerpen,M.H., Lang,D., Zange,S., Walter,M.C. and Woelfel,R.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/ON568298)


An additional genome ITM_MPX_1_Belgium was shared by [Selhorst et al. Belgian case of Monkeypox virus linked to outbreak in Portugal](https://virological.org/t/belgian-case-of-monkeypox-virus-linked-to-outbreak-in-portugal/801), but is not currently included in the build.


We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for sharing their work. Please note that although data generators have generously shared data in an open fashion, that does not mean there should be free license to publish on this data. Data generators should be cited where possible and collaborations should be sought in some circumstances. Please try to avoid scooping someone else's work. Reach out if uncertain.

This analysis focuses on just West African clade viruses. For molecular clock analyses we assume an evolutionary rate of 5 &times; 10<sup>-6</sup> (following estimates of variola virus from [Firth et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3107591/)).
We are masking several regions of the genome, including the first 1500 and last 1000 bases and a repetitive region of variable length.
